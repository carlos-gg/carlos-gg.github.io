Selected publications, and their corresponding open source code, from my previous research life when I studied exoplanets and astronomical high-contrast imaging:

## Supervised detection of exoplanets in high-contrast imaging sequences

* [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02841)
* [Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2018](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2018/05/aa31961-17/aa31961-17.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/carlos-gg/supervised-detection-exoplanets-hci)

We reformulate the exoplanet detection task (for [angular differential imaging](https://vimeo.com/125547220) sequences) building on well-established machine learning techniques to take high-contrast imaging post-processing from an unsupervised to a supervised learning context. In this new framework, we presented algorithmic solutions using two different discriminative models: SODIRF (random forests) and SODINN (neural networks). The proposed supervised detection framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in the task of discriminating planet signal from speckles. For instance, SODINN improves the true positive rate by a factor ranging from ∼2 to ∼10 wrt. low-rank based approaches, working at the same false positive rate. The code has been publicly released and can be found on GitHub.

## VIP: Vortex Image Processing Package for High-contrast Direct Imaging

* [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06184)
* [Astronomical Journal, 2017](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aa73d7/meta)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP)

The Vortex Image Processing (VIP) library is a python package dedicated to astronomical high-contrast imaging. It relies on the extensive python stack of scientific libraries and aims to provide a flexible framework for high-contrast data and image processing.

## Low-rank plus sparse decomposition for exoplanet detection in direct-imaging ADI sequences. The LLSG algorithm

* [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08381)
* [Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2016](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2016/05/aa27387-15/aa27387-15.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP/tree/master/vip_hci/llsg)

Inspired by recent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we proposed the Low-rank plus Sparse plus Gaussian noise (LLSG) decomposition of [angular differential imaging](https://vimeo.com/125547220) sequences.
