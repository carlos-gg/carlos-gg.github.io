## Challenge to improve Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Predictions using Artificial Intelligence

The [S2S-AI Data challenge](https://s2s-ai-challenge.github.io/) was organized by the World Meteorological Organization. The goal was to apply Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the improvement of subseasonal-to-seasonal precipitation and temperature forecasts. I participated as part of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center team. We reached second place. 

# As organizer

## Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge
 
The [Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/) was a community-wide effort to compare algorithms for detecting exoplanets with ground-based high-contrast imaging. I led the design and implementation of this challenge (in collaboration with several members of the high-contrast imaging community) while I worked at the Grenoble Alpes Data Institute (Université Grenoble Alpes, France). A publication is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05080).
