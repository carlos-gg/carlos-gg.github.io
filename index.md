Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a GenAI and Full-Stack LLM Development Manager at Accenture, focused on building scalable, production-grade AI systems. Since transitioning from academia to the private sector several years ago, I have dedicated my career to bridging the gap between Artificial Intelligence and tangible business impact.

In my current role, I actively participate in architecting full-stack LLM solutions, working alongside my team to move beyond hype and deliver robust applications. My technical approach is grounded in over a decade of scientific rigor, including a Ph.D. in AI and Computer Vision from the University of Liège, and research tenures as a Chair at Université Grenoble Alpes, a Marie-Curie Fellow at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, and a visiting researcher at NVIDIA. This background allows me to bring a research-grade understanding of data and model behavior into the fast-paced environment of agentic software development.
