¡Hola! You have reached my homepage so let me tell you a little bit about myself. I have a multidisciplinary background at the interface of Artificial Intelligence (AI/ML), software development, and academic data science.

I obtained a Ph.D. in Science (doctorat en Sciences) from the University of Liège, Belgium, where I carried out an interdisciplinary doctoral thesis at the interface of Computer Vision and Astrophysics. After this, I joined the Data Science Institute of the Université Grenoble Alpes, France, as a "Research Chair in Data Science for Earth and Space sciences". Currently, I am a Marie-Curie postdoctoral fellow at the Earth Sciences department of the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es) (BSC), where I work on AI applied to Earth Sciences, and also a visiting researcher at NVIDIA.
