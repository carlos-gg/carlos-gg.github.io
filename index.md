¡Hola! You have reached my homepage so let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a STARS (MSCA-COFUND) postdoctoral fellow at the Earth Sciences department of the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es) (BSC). 

I hold a Ph.D. in Science (doctorat en Sciences) from the University of Liège (Belgium) where I carried out an interdisciplinary doctoral thesis at the interface of Computer Vision and Astrophysics. After my thesis, I worked as a "Junior research Chair in Data Science for Earth and Space sciences" at the Université Grenoble Alpes (France). 

With my multidisciplinary background at the interface of software development, machine learning and academic data science, I joined the BSC to establish a research line on Artificial Intelligence for Earth Sciences. This effort focuses on the development of machine and deep learning algorithms for topics, such as statistical downscaling and bias correction techniques, data-driven parameterisations, and the study of extreme climate events.
