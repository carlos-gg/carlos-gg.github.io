Welcome to my page! I'm excited to share my professional journey with you. With a unique blend of expertise in Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Software Development, I've had the privilege of working in both academia and industry.

I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Science from the University of Li√®ge (Belgium) where I explored the intersection of AI and astrophysical image processing. Over the next five years, I carried out research in various academic positions: at the Universite Grenoble Alpes (France) as a Research Chair in Data Science, at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Spain) as a Marie-Curie postdoctoral fellow and as a visiting researcher at NVIDIA (remote). Today, I'm a Lead Data Scientist in the private sector, everaging my expertise to drive business value across diverse sectors.
